# QuickCheck
 C++ Project:
This program reads in the student answers and correct answers from two separate files respectively. It then grades the homework by comparing the student answers to the correct answers. The program then prints all incorrect answers along with their corresponding correct answers, the total number of incorrect answers, student's grades in percentage and whether students passed their tests or not.
